# Change: Update landing page hero layout and assets

## Why
The current landing page header feels cramped, uses emoji placeholders, and the office location text is outdated. The landing page also needs faster loading and a cleaner, more responsive, user-friendly design.

## What Changes
- Expand the header/hero section to fill the full viewport height
- Add a header CTA button that links to the calendar app
- Replace emoji usage on the landing page with Flaticon assets
- Update the "Our Office" location to Jakarta Selatan
- Optimize landing page loading performance
- Refine the visual theme to be clean, responsive, and user-friendly

## Impact
- Affected specs: landing-page
- Affected code: landing page layout, header CTA, content assets, performance-related loading patterns, visual theme styles
